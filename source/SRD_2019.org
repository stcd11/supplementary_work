- You have learned three classes of levers in lessons.  The most common use of levers is to create a mechanical advantage in order to assist in an action, as seen with pliers, door handles, pry bars, staplers, and wheelbarrows. 
*Your Work*
1. Find out what mechanical advantage means.
2. Use three examples, for each, describe the mechanical advantages it provides AND explain what happens when the distance between the fulcrum and the effort changes. For example, what is the mechanical advantage of a wheelbarrow? What happens when the person who pushes the wheelbarrow holds the wheelbarrow’s handles closer to the load?
